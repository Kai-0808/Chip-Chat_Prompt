### User:
Here's the current ISA:

### ISA Table:

| OpCode (Hex) | Instruction  | Field 1     | Field 2       | Field 3     | Field 4       | Field 5     | Field 6     |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `0x1`       | Convolution  | MapSize     | Stride        | Kernel      | FeatureMap    | Weight      | Bias        |
| `0x2`       | Activation   | Length      | Data Addr     | -           | -             | -           | -           |
| `0x3`       | Pooling      | WindowSize  | Stride        | Length      | Data Addr     | -           | -           |
| `0x4`       | Load         | Length      | Src Addr      | Dest Addr   | -             | -           | -           |
| `0x5`       | Store        | Length      | Src Addr      | Dest Addr   | -             | -           | -           |

### To-Do:
Fix the ISA to fit below requirement:
1.	Conv: Opcode + Map data(Saddr, Daddr, size) + Kernel data(addr, size, stride)
2.	Acti: Opcode + Map data(Saddr, Daddr)
3.	Pooling: Opcode + Map data(Saddr, Daddr, size) + Window data(size, stride) 
4.	Bias: Opcode + Map data(Saddr, Daddr, size) + Bias data(addr)
5.	Load: Opcode + data(Saddr, Daddr, size)
6.	Store: Opcode + data(Saddr, Daddr, size)
All Map size is 32*32 32-bit pixel. Addr width is 5 bits. The max kernel size is 7*7. The pooling window size is 3*3. Load/Store is for all map/kernel/window/bias. Instructions are 32-bit. 

### ChatGPT:
To design the ISA based on the provided requirements, we need to consider the total bit-width of each field in the instruction. Let's first understand the maximum bit-width required for each field:

1. **OpCode**: Let's allocate 3 bits, considering we might have up to 8 types of operations (in the current context, there are only 6).
2. **Address**: 5 bits as specified.
3. **Size**: The largest size mentioned is for the kernel which is 7x7. To represent values up to 7, we need 3 bits.
4. **Stride**: Stride for convolution can range from 1 to the size of the map. Hence, it can take values from 1-32. To represent up to 32 values, we need 5 bits. (This can be optimized if a typical stride doesn't exceed a certain number. For example, if stride values typically don't exceed 4, only 2 bits are needed.)

Now let's redesign the ISA based on the specified requirements:

### ISA Table:

| OpCode (Bin) | Instruction  | Field 1     | Field 2       | Field 3     | Field 4       | Field 5     | Field 6     |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `001`       | Conv         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | Size (3b)   | Kernel Addr (5b) | K. Size (3b)| Stride (5b)|
| `010`       | Acti         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | -           | -             | -           | -           |
| `011`       | Pooling      | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | Size (3b)   | Window Size (3b)| W. Stride (3b)| -       |
| `100`       | Bias         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | Size (3b)   | Bias Addr (5b)| -           | -           |
| `101`       | Load         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | Size (3b)   | -             | -           | -           |
| `110`       | Store        | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | Size (3b)   | -             | -           | -           |

Bit allocation (from the leftmost bit):

1. **OpCode**: 3 bits
2. **Saddr**: 5 bits
3. **Daddr**: 5 bits
4. **Size**: 3 bits
5. **Kernel/Window/Bias Addr**: 5 bits
6. **Kernel/Window Size**: 3 bits
7. **Stride**: 5 bits

We have a total of 3 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 29 bits. We still have 3 bits left within the 32-bit instruction size. Those can be left unused or reserved for future operations or flags.

Remember, for efficiency, one might look into grouping common operations, optimizing bit-width for each field, or even having variable-length instructions based on the frequency of certain operations. However, for simplicity, the above ISA will work.

### User:
The Map Size should be 5-bit.

### ChatGPT:
Alright, given that the Map Size should be 5 bits, let's adjust the ISA. We'll also need to be mindful of the total bit-width since we're limited to 32 bits for each instruction.

Let's redesign:

### ISA Table:

| OpCode (Bin) | Instruction  | Field 1     | Field 2       | Field 3     | Field 4       | Field 5     | Field 6     |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `001`       | Conv         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| Kernel Addr (5b) | K. Size (3b)| Stride (3b)|
| `010`       | Acti         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | -           | -             | -           | -           |
| `011`       | Pooling      | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| Window Size (3b)| W. Stride (3b)| -       |
| `100`       | Bias         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| Bias Addr (5b)| -           | -           |
| `101`       | Load         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| -             | -           | -           |
| `110`       | Store        | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| -             | -           | -           |

Bit allocation (from the leftmost bit):

1. **OpCode**: 3 bits
2. **Saddr**: 5 bits
3. **Daddr**: 5 bits
4. **Map Size**: 5 bits
5. **Kernel/Window/Bias Addr**: 5 bits
6. **Kernel/Window Size**: 3 bits
7. **Stride**: 3 bits

Total bits utilized per instruction: 3 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 3 = 29 bits.

We still have 3 bits left unused within the 32-bit instruction size. Those can be reserved for future use or flags. 

Given that some operations do not require all the fields, you might consider designing specialized instructions that are optimized in terms of bit-width for their specific operations. For simplicity, we've designed a consistent bit-width ISA here.

### User:
Stride should be 1-bit.

### ChatGPT:
Alright, if the Stride is represented with 1 bit, it suggests that you either have a fixed set of values it can take, or you have a mechanism elsewhere to interpret what that single bit means. Commonly, 1 bit for stride could mean either a stride of 1 (when the bit is `0`) or a stride of 2 (when the bit is `1`).

Given this constraint, let's redesign the ISA:

### ISA Table:

| OpCode (Bin) | Instruction  | Field 1     | Field 2       | Field 3     | Field 4       | Field 5     | Field 6     |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `001`       | Conv         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| Kernel Addr (5b) | K. Size (3b)| Stride (1b)|
| `010`       | Acti         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | -           | -             | -           | -           |
| `011`       | Pooling      | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| Window Size (3b)| W. Stride (1b)| -       |
| `100`       | Bias         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| Bias Addr (5b)| -           | -           |
| `101`       | Load         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| -             | -           | -           |
| `110`       | Store        | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| -             | -           | -           |

Bit allocation (from the leftmost bit):

1. **OpCode**: 3 bits
2. **Saddr**: 5 bits
3. **Daddr**: 5 bits
4. **Map Size**: 5 bits
5. **Kernel/Window/Bias Addr**: 5 bits
6. **Kernel/Window Size**: 3 bits
7. **Stride**: 1 bit

Total bits utilized per instruction: 3 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 27 bits.

You now have 5 bits left unused within the 32-bit instruction size. These could be reserved for future operations, extensions, or flags.

### User:
Add the 0-padding option to conv instruction.

### ChatGPT:
To add a 0-padding option to the convolution instruction, we need to determine how padding will be specified. Padding can be uniform (same padding for all sides) or it can be different for each side (top, bottom, left, right).

If it's uniform padding, we can represent it with a few bits, e.g., 2 bits to represent padding from 0 (no padding) to 3.

For this example, let's assume it's uniform padding and we're using 2 bits to represent it. The convolution instruction then would need an additional field, which we can call "Padding".

### ISA Table:

| OpCode (Bin) | Instruction  | Field 1     | Field 2       | Field 3     | Field 4       | Field 5     | Field 6     | Field 7     |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| `001`       | Conv         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| Kernel Addr (5b) | K. Size (3b)| Stride (1b)| Padding (2b)|
| `010`       | Acti         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | -           | -             | -           | -           | -           |
| `011`       | Pooling      | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| Window Size (3b)| W. Stride (1b)| -       | -           |
| `100`       | Bias         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| Bias Addr (5b)| -           | -           | -           |
| `101`       | Load         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| -             | -           | -           | -           |
| `110`       | Store        | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| -             | -           | -           | -           |

Bit allocation (from the leftmost bit):

1. **OpCode**: 3 bits
2. **Saddr**: 5 bits
3. **Daddr**: 5 bits
4. **Map Size**: 5 bits
5. **Kernel/Window/Bias Addr**: 5 bits
6. **Kernel/Window Size**: 3 bits
7. **Stride**: 1 bit
8. **Padding**: 2 bits

Total bits utilized for the convolution instruction: 3 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 29 bits.

For the convolution instruction, you now have 3 bits left unused within the 32-bit instruction size. These could be reserved for future operations, extensions, or flags. The other instructions utilize 27 bits each, leaving 5 bits unused.

### User:
Keep current configuration and extend the ISA to 32-bit.

### ChatGPT:
Alright, to extend the ISA to the full 32 bits, we can incorporate the padding into the convolution instruction while maintaining the existing configuration. For this case, I'm going to add the "Padding" field to the convolution instruction as 2 bits and utilize the remaining bit of the 32-bit instruction as "Reserved" for potential future use or flags.

Here's the updated ISA:

### ISA Table:

| OpCode (Bin) | Instruction  | Field 1     | Field 2       | Field 3     | Field 4       | Field 5     | Field 6     | Field 7     | Field 8     |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| `001`       | Conv         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| Kernel Addr (5b) | K. Size (3b)| Stride (1b)| Padding (2b)| Reserved (1b)|
| `010`       | Acti         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | -           | -             | -           | -           | -           | Reserved (5b)|
| `011`       | Pooling      | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| Window Size (3b)| W. Stride (1b)| -       | -           | Reserved (5b)|
| `100`       | Bias         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| Bias Addr (5b)| -           | -           | -           | Reserved (5b)|
| `101`       | Load         | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| -             | -           | -           | -           | Reserved (5b)|
| `110`       | Store        | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| -             | -           | -           | -           | Reserved (5b)|

Bit allocation (from the leftmost bit):

1. **OpCode**: 3 bits
2. **Saddr**: 5 bits
3. **Daddr**: 5 bits
4. **Map Size**: 5 bits
5. **Kernel/Window/Bias Addr**: 5 bits
6. **Kernel/Window Size**: 3 bits
7. **Stride**: 1 bit
8. **Padding**: 2 bits (only for Conv)
9. **Reserved**: Varies (1b for Conv, 5b for others)

Now, each instruction occupies the full 32 bits. This design allows for clear demarcation of fields, future flexibility with the "Reserved" bits, and ensures that each instruction fits uniformly into memory or a cache line.

### User:
Can you add 2 bits in load/store to represent the data type they are going to deal with? I.e., feature maps, weights, and bias.

### ChatGPT:
Certainly! To represent different data types with 2 bits, you can represent up to 4 distinct types. Given the options you've mentioned: feature maps, weights, and bias, we have room for one more data type, which we can label as "Other" or "Reserved" for future use.

Let's designate these data types as:

1. Feature Maps: `00`
2. Weights: `01`
3. Bias: `10`
4. Reserved/Other: `11`

Now, let's integrate this into the ISA:

### ISA Table:

| OpCode (Bin) | Instruction  | Field 1     | Field 2       | Field 3     | Field 4       | Field 5     | Field 6     | Field 7     | Field 8     | Field 9     |

| `110`       | Store        | Saddr (5b)  | Daddr (5b)    | M. Size (5b)| Data Type (2b)| -           | -           | -           | Reserved (3b)| -           |

Bit allocation (from the leftmost bit):

1. **OpCode**: 3 bits
2. **Saddr**: 5 bits
3. **Daddr**: 5 bits
4. **Map Size**: 5 bits
5. **Kernel/Window/Bias Addr/Data Type**: 5 bits (The 5th bit for Load/Store is used for the first bit of Data Type)
6. **Kernel/Window Size/Data Type**: 3 bits (The 3rd bit for Load/Store is used for the second bit of Data Type)
7. **Stride**: 1 bit
8. **Padding**: 2 bits (only for Conv)
9. **Reserved**: Varies (1b for Conv, 3b for Load/Store, and 5b for others)

Each instruction now fills the full 32-bit word.

### User:
Put Window Size  to Field 5 and W. Stride  to Field 6. 

### ChatGPT:
Got it. I'll rearrange the fields for the Pooling instruction by placing the "Window Size" in Field 5 and "W. Stride" in Field 6, as per your request.

Here's the updated ISA:

### ISA Table:

Bit allocation (from the leftmost bit):

1. **OpCode**: 3 bits
2. **Saddr**: 5 bits
3. **Daddr**: 5 bits
4. **Map Size**: 5 bits
5. **Kernel/Window/Bias Addr/Data Type**: 5 bits (The 5th bit for Load/Store is used for the first bit of Data Type; for Pooling this field is left empty)
6. **Kernel/Window Size/Data Type/Stride**: 3 bits (The 3rd bit for Load/Store is used for the second bit of Data Type; for Pooling, "Window Size" fills this space)
7. **Stride**: 1 bit
8. **Padding**: 2 bits (only for Conv)
9. **Reserved**: Varies (1b for Conv, 3b for Load/Store, and 5b for others)

Each instruction occupies the full 32-bit space. The Pooling instruction now has the "Window Size" in Field 5 and "W. Stride" in Field 6.
