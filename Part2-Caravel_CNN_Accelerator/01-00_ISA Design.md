## 01-00_ISA Design
### User:
Act as a professional SystemVerilog programmer and AI accelerator designer. I need to use an LLM to create a hardware accelerator that will be taped out for a coontest. I was thinking of creating a AI accelerator NPU type thing. More specifically, I want my design to accelerate multiple CNN models provided below. What steps should I take to use ChatGPT to design this. I am using the Skywater foundries 130nm process and I have about ~10mm^2 for the area of the ASIC. The chip already includes a stripped-down RISC-V processor, communicating wuth my design using 32-bits wishbonebus.

### ChatGPT:
Designing an AI hardware accelerator for the given CNN models (Inception, ResNet, and VGG) involves a systematic process that leverages the structure and patterns present in the models. Here's a suggested approach to tackle the problem:

1. **Understand the Neural Network Structures**:
   - Observe the common patterns across all models.
     - Convolutional layers with varying kernel sizes (1x1, 3x3, 5x5, 7x7).
     - Max pooling layers.
     - Fully connected layers (Dense layers).
     - Batch normalization and ReLU activations.
     - Skip connections (for ResNet).

2. **Profiling and Bottleneck Analysis**:
   - Profile the models to identify computation and memory bottlenecks.
   - Based on the profiling results, prioritize which layers or operations need dedicated hardware acceleration.

3. **Define Hardware Architecture**:
   - Define a systolic array or tiled architecture for efficient matrix multiplications (especially for convolution and fully connected layers).
   - Implement specialized units for pooling.
   - Use buffers or caches to store intermediate data and reduce data movement. 
   - Implement a controller to manage data flow, layers' execution, and synchronization.

4. **Optimizations**:
   - Use weight compression techniques to reduce the size of the neural network models.
   - Use quantization to reduce the precision of weights and activations, hence saving power and improving speed.
   - Use batching to process multiple data samples at once.

5. **On-Chip Memory Design**:
   - Design SRAM blocks or caches for weights, intermediate feature maps, and activations.
   - Design memory hierarchy to balance between on-chip and off-chip memory accesses.

6. **Design Interface**:
   - Implement a Wishbone bus interface to communicate with the existing RISC-V processor.
   - Define memory-mapped registers for the accelerator for configuration, status checking, and data exchange.

7. **Design Verification**:
   - Use SystemVerilog to create testbenches for each module.
   - Perform simulation to verify the functionality.
   - Use assertions to ensure that corner cases are met.

8. **Physical Design**:
   - Perform synthesis to translate the RTL design to gate-level representation.
   - Layout the design for the Skywater 130nm process.
   - Perform place and route.
   - Check the design against the area constraint (~10mm^2).

9. **Integration and System-level Testing**:
   - Integrate the accelerator with the RISC-V processor.
   - Run system-level tests to ensure end-to-end functionality.

10. **Documentation and Clean-up**:
   - Document the architecture, interfaces, and design decisions.
   - Clean up the code and maintain a proper directory structure for easy navigation.

11. **Bonus: Generate a Software SDK**:
   - Develop a lightweight software SDK that allows users to easily offload computations from the RISC-V processor to your accelerator. This might involve defining an API for model loading, data input/output, and triggering computations.

**Considerations with ChatGPT**:

- ChatGPT can assist in defining architectures, suggesting optimizations, and reviewing code snippets. However, it cannot run SystemVerilog simulations or perform synthesis and physical design.
- If you have specific questions or need further explanations on any of the steps, feel free to ask.

Remember that designing a hardware accelerator is a complex task, and the key is iterative refinement. Your initial design might not be optimal, but with iterations and optimizations, it can be improved over time.

### User:
Can you design instructions I can include in my accelerator? I only have a 32-bit data interface and 32-bit address interface available. 

### ChatGPT:
Certainly! When designing an instruction set for your accelerator, you need to consider the operations you want to accelerate and how you'll interface with the accelerator.

Let's lay down some foundational concepts and then propose a simple instruction set for the AI accelerator.

### Concepts:
1. **Operation Codes (OpCodes)**: Determine the type of operation (e.g., convolution, pooling, activation).
2. **Operands**: Specify data or parameters for the operation.
3. **Addressing Modes**: Determine how operands are accessed (e.g., immediate, direct, indirect).
4. **Control Bits**: Specify the behavior of the operation (e.g., start, stop, reset).

Given the 32-bit data and address interface, here's a basic proposal:

### 32-bit Instruction Format:
```
[31:28]   [27:24]   [23:16]     [15:0]
OpCode    Operand   Addressing  Data/Address
```

### Instructions:

1. **Convolution**:
   - OpCode: `0001`
   - Operand: Specifies the kernel size (e.g., `0001` for 1x1, `0011` for 3x3).
   - Addressing: Immediate (`0001`) or Direct (`0010`)
   - Data/Address: Immediate value or memory address.

2. **Pooling**:
   - OpCode: `0010`
   - Operand: Type of pooling (`0001` for Max pooling, `0010` for Average pooling).
   - Addressing: Immediate or Direct
   - Data/Address: Immediate value or memory address.

3. **Activation**:
   - OpCode: `0011`
   - Operand: Activation type (e.g., `0001` for ReLU, `0010` for Sigmoid).
   - Addressing: Immediate or Direct
   - Data/Address: Immediate value or memory address.

4. **Dense (Fully Connected)**:
   - OpCode: `0100`
   - Operand: Not used (could be reserved for future use or other parameters).
   - Addressing: Immediate or Direct
   - Data/Address: Immediate value or memory address.

5. **Control Operations**:
   - Start: 
     - OpCode: `1000`
     - Initiates the computation.
   - Stop:
     - OpCode: `1001`
     - Stops the computation.
   - Reset:
     - OpCode: `1010`
     - Resets the accelerator.

### Example:

To start a 3x3 convolution operation with weights starting from address `0x4000`, the instruction would be:
```
0001 0011 0010 0100 0000 0000
```

### Notes:
1. The instruction format is flexible. Depending on your accelerator's architecture and design, you may need more or fewer bits for different fields.
2. Consider other instructions or modifiers that can enhance the usability and efficiency of the accelerator, such as loading weights, storing results, setting batch size, etc.
3. Ensure proper error handling and signaling for invalid instructions.
4. Given the complexity of neural networks, especially modern architectures like Inception and ResNet, managing the flow and orchestration might need additional instructions or state machines.
5. These instructions can be loaded into your accelerator via the RISC-V processor, which then decodes and executes them in order.

Remember, this is a basic instruction set tailored to the 32-bit interface you described. Depending on the exact requirements, performance goals, and features of your accelerator, you might need to make adjustments or expansions to this instruction set.

### User:
Addressing Mode is unnecessary. For the conv instruction, include  the kernel size, Feature map addr, Weight addr,  and Bias addr. For the activation instruction, include Parameter length (the operand size) and data addr (the first address of the operand data matrix). For the pooling instruction, include length (the operand data length), data addr (the first address of the operand matrix). Also, remove the control instruction.

### ChatGPT:
Given your new requirements, let's redesign the instruction set:

### 32-bit Instruction Format:

1. **Convolution**:
```
[31:28]   [27:26]   [25:16]     [15:8]     [7:0]
OpCode    Kernel   FeatureMap  Weight    Bias
```
Where:
   - OpCode: `0001`
   - Kernel: Specifies the kernel size (`00` for 1x1, `01` for 3x3, `10` for 5x5, `11` for 7x7). 
   - FeatureMap: Address of the feature map (or the starting address).
   - Weight: Address of the weights.
   - Bias: Address of the bias.

2. **Activation**:
```
[31:28]   [27:24]   [23:16]      [15:0]
OpCode   Length   Not Used   Data Addr
```
Where:
   - OpCode: `0010`
   - Length: Specifies the operand size.
   - Data Addr: The starting address of the operand data matrix.

3. **Pooling**:
```
[31:28]   [27:24]   [23:16]      [15:0]
OpCode   Length   Not Used   Data Addr
```
Where:
   - OpCode: `0011`
   - Length: Specifies the operand data length.
   - Data Addr: The starting address of the operand matrix.

### Notes:

- The above format assumes that 8-bit addressing is sufficient to cover the memory range you're using for feature maps, weights, and biases. If you need a larger address range, you may need to adjust the length fields or use multiple instruction words for certain operations.
  
- The "Not Used" bits can be reserved for future expansion or other parameters that might be needed.

- Since you've removed control instructions, ensure that you have a way to signal the accelerator to start processing the loaded instructions and manage its execution flow.

- While the above instruction set is concise, it assumes the accelerator has prior knowledge about certain properties (like data layout, tensor dimensions, etc.). Make sure such assumptions are well-documented.

Finally, remember that the efficiency of the instruction set will also depend on how well the software stack is designed to generate these instructions from higher-level neural network representations.

### User:
Construct the ISA table.

### ChatGPT:
Certainly! Here's the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) table for the specified operations:

| OpCode (Hex) | Instruction | Description                                                  | Field 1       | Field 2     | Field 3    | Field 4       |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| `0x1`       | Convolution | Performs convolution operation on given feature map using specified weights and biases | Kernel Size  | FeatureMap Addr | Weight Addr | Bias Addr    |
| `0x2`       | Activation  | Applies activation function on data matrix of given length   | Operand Length | -           | -          | Data Addr    |
| `0x3`       | Pooling     | Applies pooling operation on data matrix of given length     | Operand Length | -           | -          | Data Addr    |

### Field Descriptions:

- **Kernel Size**: Specifies the size of the convolution kernel. The encoding can be:
  - `00`: 1x1
  - `01`: 3x3
  - `10`: 5x5
  - `11`: 7x7

- **FeatureMap Addr**: The starting address of the feature map in memory.

- **Weight Addr**: The starting address of the convolution weights in memory.

- **Bias Addr**: The starting address of the bias values in memory.

- **Operand Length**: Specifies the size of the operand. This can be used by the activation and pooling functions to determine how much data to process.

- **Data Addr**: The starting address of the data matrix in memory.

The "-" in the table indicates that the field is not used for that instruction.

### Assumptions:

1. Each instruction is 32 bits long.
2. Addressing is done in 8-bit chunks (meaning we can directly address 256 unique memory locations with each address field). If more memory locations are needed, then the ISA needs modifications.
3. The accelerator knows other details, like the data layout in memory, tensor shapes, and strides, either through conventions or configuration registers not specified in the ISA.

This table provides a clear overview of the instructions, their opcodes, and associated fields. Depending on the exact implementation details and requirements, the ISA might need adjustments.

### User:
Take stride into consideration in Conv and pooling.

### ChatGPT:
Taking stride into consideration, we can add a stride field to both the Convolution and Pooling instructions. However, given the constraints of the 32-bit instruction format, this might require a little bit of repackaging of the information.

Here's how we can incorporate the stride:

### 32-bit Instruction Format:

1. **Convolution**:
```
[31:28]   [27:26]   [25:24]     [23:16]     [15:8]     [7:0]
OpCode    Kernel   Stride     FeatureMap  Weight    Bias
```
Where:
   - Stride: Specifies the stride for the convolution operation. For simplicity, we assume the stride is the same in both the x and y dimensions. A common range might be:
     - `00`: Stride 1
     - `01`: Stride 2
     - `10`: Stride 3
     - `11`: Reserved/Stride 4

2. **Activation**:
Remains unchanged from previous description.

3. **Pooling**:
```
[31:28]   [27:26]   [25:24]   [23:16]      [15:0]
OpCode   PoolType  Stride    Length    Data Addr
```
Where:
   - PoolType: Type of pooling (`00` for Max pooling, `01` for Average pooling).
   - Stride: As described in the Convolution instruction.
   - Length: Specifies the operand data length.
   - Data Addr: The starting address of the operand matrix.

### ISA Table:

| OpCode (Hex) | Instruction | Description                                                  | Field 1       | Field 2     | Field 3    | Field 4       | Field 5 |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|---------------|---------|
| `0x1`       | Convolution | Convolution operation on feature map with weights and biases | Kernel Size  | Stride      | FeatureMap Addr | Weight Addr | Bias Addr |
| `0x2`       | Activation  | Activation function on data matrix of given length           | Operand Length | -           | -          | Data Addr    | -       |
| `0x3`       | Pooling     | Pooling operation on data matrix of given length             | PoolType      | Stride      | Length     | Data Addr    | -       |

### Notes:

1. Due to the inclusion of the Stride field, the address space for FeatureMap, Weight, and Bias is reduced. If more memory addressing is needed, the ISA will need further adjustments.
2. The proposed ISA assumes that strides up to 3 are sufficient for the given models. If different stride values are essential, the Stride field encoding can be updated accordingly.
3. PoolType was added to differentiate between types of pooling operations.
4. Remember that the actual implementation might need to tweak these based on other factors like typical sizes of tensors, memory layout, and more. 

Including stride in the ISA is crucial for flexibility in the convolution and pooling operations. It provides the accelerator with the capability to process a wide variety of neural network architectures.

### User:
Add activation type (ReLU / Sigmoid). 

### ChatGPT:
Certainly! To incorporate the activation type into the Activation instruction, we can repurpose a couple of bits to denote the type of activation being applied. Here's how we can update the ISA to include this:

### 32-bit Instruction Format:

1. **Convolution**:
```
[31:28]   [27:26]   [25:24]     [23:16]     [15:8]     [7:0]
OpCode    Kernel   Stride     FeatureMap  Weight    Bias
```

2. **Activation**:
```
[31:28]   [27:26]   [25:24]   [23:16]      [15:0]
OpCode   ActType   Length    Not Used   Data Addr
```
Where:
   - ActType: Specifies the type of activation.
     - `00`: ReLU
     - `01`: Sigmoid
     - `10`: Reserved
     - `11`: Reserved (for future use, such as Tanh or others)

3. **Pooling**:
```
[31:28]   [27:26]   [25:24]   [23:16]      [15:0]
OpCode   PoolType  Stride    Length    Data Addr
```

### ISA Table:

| OpCode (Hex) | Instruction | Description                                                  | Field 1      | Field 2     | Field 3        | Field 4       | Field 5 |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| `0x1`       | Convolution | Convolution operation on feature map with weights and biases | Kernel Size  | Stride      | FeatureMap Addr | Weight Addr   | Bias Addr |
| `0x2`       | Activation  | Applies the specified activation function on the data matrix | Activation Type | Length   | -              | Data Addr    | -       |
| `0x3`       | Pooling     | Pooling operation on data matrix of given length             | PoolType     | Stride      | Length         | Data Addr    | -       |

### Notes:

1. The addition of the `ActType` field allows the hardware to determine which activation function to apply. The reserved bits provide flexibility for adding more activation functions in the future.
2. The lengths and encodings of the different fields are based on the assumption of a 32-bit instruction word. Depending on the application and specific requirements, these might need adjustments.
3. Given the constraints of the 32-bit instruction word, trade-offs were made in terms of address space and available options for certain fields. You might consider a multi-word instruction format if more flexibility or address space is needed.
4. As always, the actual implementation might need to tweak this ISA based on other factors like typical sizes of tensors, memory layout, and more.

### User:
Add store/load for data transfer.

### ChatGPT:
Including store/load instructions is crucial for data transfers between the main memory and the accelerator's local memory or registers. These instructions would typically be used to load input data, weights, biases into the accelerator and store results back to the main memory.

### 32-bit Instruction Format:

#### Store:
```
[31:28]   [27:16]       [15:0]
OpCode   Src Addr     Dest Addr
```

#### Load:
```
[31:28]   [27:16]       [15:0]
OpCode   Src Addr     Dest Addr
```

Where:
- **Src Addr**: Source address in memory.
- **Dest Addr**: Destination address in memory or accelerator.

### ISA Table (Updated):

| OpCode (Hex) | Instruction | Description                                                  | Field 1      | Field 2     | Field 3        | Field 4       | Field 5 |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| `0x1`       | Convolution | Convolution operation on feature map with weights and biases | Kernel Size  | Stride      | FeatureMap Addr | Weight Addr   | Bias Addr |
| `0x2`       | Activation  | Applies the specified activation function on the data matrix | Activation Type | Length   | -              | Data Addr    | -       |
| `0x3`       | Pooling     | Pooling operation on data matrix of given length             | PoolType     | Stride      | Length         | Data Addr    | -       |
| `0x4`       | Load        | Loads data from main memory to accelerator                   | Src Addr     | -           | -              | Dest Addr    | -       |
| `0x5`       | Store       | Stores data from accelerator to main memory                  | Src Addr     | -           | -              | Dest Addr    | -       |

### Assumptions and Notes:

1. The **Load** instruction fetches data from the `Src Addr` in the main memory and places it at the `Dest Addr` in the accelerator's local memory or registers.
   
2. The **Store** instruction transfers data from the `Src Addr` in the accelerator's local memory or registers to the `Dest Addr` in the main memory.

3. Depending on the memory layout and how data is typically loaded/stored, you might need to consider additional fields, such as length, to specify how much data to transfer. This could mean adjusting the size of the address fields or introducing multi-word instructions.

4. The addressing mode assumes direct addressing, but if you have a large memory space, or if you have an indexing/offset mechanism, you might need to adjust the instruction format.

5. Transfers might be aligned (e.g., always on cache-line boundaries) or might have certain size restrictions (e.g., always transfer 128 bytes). This should be reflected in the ISA's semantics and documentation.

Incorporating these data transfer operations will ensure that the accelerator can function in a broader system context, fetching its required data and outputting its results.

### User:
Add length to store/load.

### ChatGPT:
To include the length for data transfer in the store/load instructions, we'll allocate some bits for the length field in the 32-bit instruction format. This will require resizing or repurposing other fields.

### 32-bit Instruction Format:

#### Store:
```
[31:28]   [27:24]   [23:16]       [15:0]
OpCode   Length    Src Addr     Dest Addr
```

#### Load:
```
[31:28]   [27:24]   [23:16]       [15:0]
OpCode   Length    Src Addr     Dest Addr
```

Where:
- **Length**: Number of data units to transfer. Depending on system design, this could represent bytes, words, or blocks of data.
- **Src Addr**: Source address in memory.
- **Dest Addr**: Destination address in memory or accelerator.

### Updated ISA Table:

| OpCode (Hex) | Instruction | Description                                                  | Field 1      | Field 2     | Field 3        | Field 4       |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| `0x1`       | Convolution | Convolution operation on feature map with weights and biases | Kernel Size  | Stride      | FeatureMap Addr | Weight Addr   |
| `0x2`       | Activation  | Applies the specified activation function on the data matrix | Activation Type | Length   | -              | Data Addr    |
| `0x3`       | Pooling     | Pooling operation on data matrix of given length             | PoolType     | Stride      | Length         | Data Addr    |
| `0x4`       | Load        | Loads data from main memory to accelerator                   | Length       | Src Addr    | -              | Dest Addr    |
| `0x5`       | Store       | Stores data from accelerator to main memory                  | Length       | Src Addr    | -              | Dest Addr    |

### Assumptions and Notes:

1. The **Length** field denotes the amount of data to transfer. The units for this (e.g., byte, word, etc.) need to be defined based on the system's requirements and how memory is addressed.

2. The size of the **Src Addr** and **Dest Addr** fields has been reduced to make space for the Length field. This limits the directly addressable space. If larger address spaces are necessary, consider other methods like base-plus-offset addressing or extending the instruction length.

3. If a specific alignment or granularity is expected for data transfers, this should be well-documented in the ISA semantics. For example, if length is in terms of 4-byte words, then a length of `3` would imply 12 bytes.

4. To accommodate a variety of scenarios, the system software or compiler should handle edge cases, such as when the data length exceeds the maximum representable value in the Length field. In such cases, multiple store/load instructions might be issued in sequence.

5. Efficiency considerations might also drive decisions on the granularity of transfers. For instance, aligned transfers on cache line boundaries might be more efficient than arbitrary byte-level transfers.

Incorporating the length field in the store/load instructions provides the system with finer granularity control over data transfers, enhancing flexibility and efficiency.

### User:
For conv ins, you need to add bias addr.

### ChatGPT:
My apologies for the oversight. Let's revise the instruction format for the `Conv` instruction to include the `Bias Addr` field. To accommodate this, we'll have to adjust the bit allocation within the 32-bit instruction format.

### Revised 32-bit Instruction Format for Conv:

```
[31:28]   [27:26]   [25:24]     [23:18]     [17:12]     [11:6]     [5:0]
OpCode    Kernel   Stride     FeatureMap  Weight      Bias       Not Used
```

Where:
- **Kernel**: Specifies the size of the convolution kernel.
- **Stride**: Specifies the stride for the convolution operation.
- **FeatureMap**: Address of the feature map (6 bits for demonstration).
- **Weight**: Address of the convolution weights (6 bits for demonstration).
- **Bias**: Address of the bias values (6 bits for demonstration).
- **Not Used**: These bits can be reserved for future use or expansion.

### Updated ISA Table:

| OpCode (Hex) | Instruction | Description                                                  | Field 1      | Field 2     | Field 3        | Field 4       | Field 5     | Field 6     |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `0x1`       | Convolution | Convolution operation on a given feature map using specified weights and biases | Kernel Size  | Stride      | FeatureMap Addr | Weight Addr  | Bias Addr   | Not Used    |
| `0x2`       | Activation  | Applies the specified activation function on the data matrix | Activation Type | Length   | -              | Data Addr    | -           | -           |
| `0x3`       | Pooling     | Pooling operation on data matrix of given length             | PoolType     | Stride      | Length         | Data Addr    | -           | -           |
| `0x4`       | Load        | Loads data from main memory to accelerator                   | Length       | Src Addr    | -              | Dest Addr    | -           | -           |
| `0x5`       | Store       | Stores data from accelerator to main memory                  | Length       | Src Addr    | -              | Dest Addr    | -           | -           |

### Notes:

1. The addressing fields (FeatureMap, Weight, Bias) in this example are shown as 6 bits for illustrative purposes, and might not be sufficient for a real-world application. Depending on your address space requirements, you might need to adjust these fields' sizes, which could involve expanding the instruction length or repurposing other bits.
2. It's important to decide on the granularity of your address space. If your addresses refer to byte locations, word locations, or block locations, it will have implications on how much memory you can address and how you structure your data in memory.
3. As always, efficiency and real-world requirements might drive tweaks and changes to the ISA. It's a good practice to simulate and profile workloads to ensure the ISA is suitable for the target applications.

### User:
I need load at least 10000 feature maps. extend the length of addr. Make sure you fully use the 32-bit space and prevent "not used". 

### ChatGPT:
Given your requirement to load at least 10,000 feature maps, addressing needs more bits to cater to this demand. In the interest of utilizing the full 32-bit space and given the design constraints, I propose the following format:

### Revised 32-bit Instruction Format for Conv:

```
[31:28]   [27:26]   [25:24]     [23:14]     [13:4]     [3:0]
OpCode    Kernel   Stride     FeatureMap  Weight      Bias
```

Where:
- **FeatureMap**: Address of the feature map (10 bits).
- **Weight**: Address of the convolution weights (10 bits).
- **Bias**: Address of the bias values (4 bits).

With 10 bits for the FeatureMap, we can address up to 2^10 = 1,024 distinct locations. If each location represents a collection or block of feature maps (rather than an individual map), then addressing 10,000 feature maps is feasible. For example, if each location corresponds to 10 feature maps, then 10 x 1,024 = 10,240 feature maps can be addressed, meeting your requirement.

### Updated ISA Table:

| OpCode (Hex) | Instruction | Description                                                  | Field 1      | Field 2     | Field 3        | Field 4       | Field 5     |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| `0x1`       | Convolution | Convolution operation on a given feature map using specified weights and biases | Kernel Size  | Stride      | FeatureMap Addr | Weight Addr  | Bias Addr   |
| `0x2`       | Activation  | Applies the specified activation function on the data matrix | Activation Type | Length   | -              | Data Addr    | -           |
| `0x3`       | Pooling     | Pooling operation on data matrix of given length             | PoolType     | Stride      | Length         | Data Addr    | -           |
| `0x4`       | Load        | Loads data from main memory to accelerator                   | Length       | Src Addr    | -              | Dest Addr    | -           |
| `0x5`       | Store       | Stores data from accelerator to main memory                  | Length       | Src Addr    | -              | Dest Addr    | -           |

### Notes:

1. The exact distribution of address bits among `FeatureMap`, `Weight`, and `Bias` fields depends on the expected sizes and layouts of these components. The current distribution is just one possibility, and adjustments might be needed based on actual requirements.
2. It's worth noting that the reduced addressing space for `Bias` (only 4 bits) might be a limitation. But, given that biases are typically 1D arrays with size equal to the number of output channels, and assuming that you can load these biases in groups or blocks, this limitation might be manageable. If not, consider reworking the bit allocations or the memory layout strategy.
3. As always, the memory management strategy, alignment, and granularity will influence the efficiency and performance of the accelerator. Ensure to design these aspects in harmony with the ISA to maximize efficiency.

### User:
Show me the ISA table with bit length and essential Explanation and Notes.

### ChatGPT:
Certainly! Here's the revised ISA table detailing the bit lengths:

### ISA Table:

| OpCode (Hex) | Instruction  | Bit [31:28] | Field 1         | Bit [27:26] | Field 2        | Bit [25:24] | Field 3         | Bit [23:14] | Field 4       | Bit [13:4]  | Field 5       | Bit [3:0]  |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| `0x1`       | Convolution  | OpCode      | Kernel Size     | Kernel      | Stride         | Stride      | FeatureMap Addr | FeatureMap  | Weight Addr   | Weight      | Bias Addr     | Bias      |
| `0x2`       | Activation   | OpCode      | Activation Type | ActType     | Length         | Length      | -               | -           | Data Addr     | Data Addr   | -             | -         |
| `0x3`       | Pooling      | OpCode      | PoolType        | PoolType    | Stride         | Stride      | Length          | Length      | Data Addr     | Data Addr   | -             | -         |
| `0x4`       | Load         | OpCode      | Length         | Length      | Src Addr       | Src Addr    | -               | -           | Dest Addr     | Dest Addr   | -             | -         |
| `0x5`       | Store        | OpCode      | Length         | Length      | Src Addr       | Src Addr    | -               | -           | Dest Addr     | Dest Addr   | -             | -         |

### Essential Explanation:

- **OpCode**: 4-bit operation code that defines the type of instruction.
- **Kernel Size**: 2-bit field representing the size of the convolution kernel. For instance, `01` might represent a 3x3 kernel.
- **Stride**: 2-bit field specifying the convolution operation stride.
- **FeatureMap Addr**: 10-bit address for the feature map.
- **Weight Addr**: 10-bit address for convolution weights.
- **Bias Addr**: 4-bit address for bias values.
- **Activation Type (ActType)**: 2-bit code specifying the type of activation function to apply, such as `00` for ReLU or `01` for Sigmoid.
- **PoolType**: 2-bit field that specifies the type of pooling operation. E.g., `00` for Max pooling and `01` for Average pooling.
- **Length**: Used in Activation, Load, and Store operations to indicate the size of data or operand. In Load and Store, this might signify the amount of data to transfer. In Activation, it represents the operand size.
- **Data Addr**: Address in memory or within the accelerator for data. Used by Activation, Pooling, Load, and Store operations.
  
### Notes:

1. The exact interpretation of each field (e.g., how Kernel Size `01` maps to a 3x3 kernel) would be defined in the ISA's detailed specifications.
  
2. The use of 10 bits for FeatureMap and Weight addresses allows for addressing 1,024 unique locations. If each location corresponds to a group of feature maps or weights, you can accommodate larger numbers. E.g., if each location corresponds to a block of 10 feature maps, then you can address up to 10,240 feature maps.

3. The 4-bit Bias address field provides direct addressing to 16 unique bias locations. Depending on how biases are organized in memory (e.g., grouped by layers or blocks), this can be used to load biases for multiple layers.

4. Addressing typically refers to the start of a memory segment. For example, the `FeatureMap Addr` points to the start of the feature map data, and the length or size of the data would be implied based on the operation or context.

5. The ISA's design assumes that the operations are aligned with the memory organization and data layout strategy. Proper care should be taken during implementation to ensure efficient data access and minimal memory contention.

6. For further scalability or to accommodate future expansions, additional mechanisms like indirect addressing or multi-word instructions might be needed.

### User:
Convolution instruction needs to include map size. (28x28 -> 14x14 -> 7x7 -> 4x4 -> 2x2 -> 1x1)

### ChatGPT:
Got it. Considering the map sizes you've provided and to incorporate this into the Convolution instruction, we'll need to adjust our ISA. Given the limited 32-bit instruction space, we'll have to optimize our fields judiciously.

One way to include map sizes is to encode them as a separate field in the instruction. Given that the sizes you've provided are powers of 2 (or half of them), we can encode these sizes efficiently.

### Revised 32-bit Instruction Format for Conv:

```
[31:28]   [27:25]   [24:23]     [22:21]     [20:11]     [10:1]     [0]
OpCode    MapSize   Kernel     Stride      FeatureMap  Weight     Bias
```

Where:
- **MapSize**: Encoding for the map size:
  - `000`: 28x28
  - `001`: 14x14
  - `010`: 7x7
  - `011`: 4x4
  - `100`: 2x2
  - `101`: 1x1
  - `110` & `111`: Reserved for potential future sizes

### Updated ISA Table:

| OpCode (Hex) | Instruction  | Bit [31:28] | Field 1         | Bit [27:25] | Field 2       | Bit [24:23] | Field 3         | Bit [22:21] | Field 4         | Bit [20:11] | Field 5       | Bit [10:1] | Field 6     | Bit [0]  |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `0x1`       | Convolution  | OpCode      | MapSize         | MapSize     | Kernel Size   | Kernel      | Stride          | Stride      | FeatureMap Addr | FeatureMap  | Weight Addr   | Weight    | Bias Addr   | Bias    |
| ...         | ...          | ...         | ...             | ...         | ...           | ...         | ...             | ...         | ...             | ...         | ...           | ...       | ...         | ...     |

### Notes:

1. The Bit columns in the table help indicate the range of bits used for each field in the instruction.
   
2. By encoding map sizes, the accelerator can optimize its data handling based on the context. This might influence things like memory access patterns or even the arrangement of processing elements.

3. The choice of encoding map sizes is based on the sizes you've provided. If other sizes are expected in the future, the encoding might need adjustments.

4. Address space for FeatureMap, Weight, and Bias have been reduced to fit the map size. This layout assumes block-based addressing where each address points to a block of related data, rather than individual entries. Adjustments might be needed based on actual memory organization.

5. As the design evolves, it's crucial to revisit the ISA and ensure it aligns well with typical use-cases and data patterns to ensure efficient hardware utilization.

### User:
Reduce the stride width to one.

### ChatGPT:
If the stride width is reduced to a single bit, it means we are allowing for two possible stride values, typically `1` and `2`. This change will free up one bit, which can be reallocated elsewhere.

Let's adjust the 32-bit instruction format for the Convolution operation accordingly:

### Revised 32-bit Instruction Format for Conv:

```
[31:28]   [27:25]   [24]       [23:22]     [21:12]     [11:2]     [1:0]
OpCode    MapSize   Stride     Kernel      FeatureMap  Weight     Bias
```

Where:
- **Stride**: Encoding for the stride:
  - `0`: Stride of 1
  - `1`: Stride of 2

### Updated ISA Table:

| OpCode (Hex) | Instruction  | Bit [31:28] | Field 1         | Bit [27:25] | Field 2       | Bit [24]    | Field 3       | Bit [23:22] | Field 4         | Bit [21:12] | Field 5       | Bit [11:2] | Field 6     | Bit [1:0] |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `0x1`       | Convolution  | OpCode      | MapSize         | MapSize     | Stride        | Stride      | Kernel Size   | Kernel      | FeatureMap Addr | FeatureMap  | Weight Addr   | Weight    | Bias Addr   | Bias     |
| ...         | ...          | ...         | ...             | ...         | ...           | ...         | ...           | ...         | ...             | ...         | ...           | ...       | ...         | ...      |

### Notes:

1. By reducing the stride width to one bit, we've simplified the handling of stride but have limited it to two potential values. This is fine as long as the design only needs strides of `1` and `2`.

2. The freed bit from reducing the stride's width was added to the bias address, increasing its range.

3. As usual, the actual memory layout, data patterns, and design requirements might prompt further adjustments to the ISA. Regular evaluations ensure the ISA remains efficient and relevant to the target use-cases.

### ChatGPT:
Understood. Since there's only one type of activation function (ReLU) used in all three models, we can simplify the ISA by removing the `ActType` field from the Activation instruction. This will free up additional bits that can be utilized elsewhere or provide more addressing space.

Here's the modified ISA:

### ChatGPT:
Noted. Since only one type of pooling function (MaxPooling) is used in all three models, we can further simplify the ISA by removing the `PoolType` field from the Pooling instruction. This action will free up an additional bit, which can be utilized elsewhere or provide more addressing space.

3. As always, the alignment of the ISA with memory organization, hardware design, and most common operations ensures optimal efficiency. Regular evaluations and updates to the ISA are essential as design requirements evolve.

### User:
Noticing that in tha provided models, only 2*2 & 3*3 windows are used.

### ChatGPT:
Got it. Since only 2x2 and 3x3 window sizes are used in the provided models, we can further simplify the `WindowSize` field for the Pooling instruction to just 1 bit.

Here's the updated ISA reflecting these constraints:
