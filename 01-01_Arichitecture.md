## 01-01_Arichitecture
### User:
I am trying to make a CNN AI accelerator with the following ISA:

### ISA Table:

| OpCode (Hex) | Instruction  | Field 1     | Field 2       | Field 3     | Field 4       | Field 5     | Field 6     |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `0x1`       | Convolution  | MapSize     | Stride        | Kernel      | FeatureMap    | Weight      | Bias        |
| `0x2`       | Activation   | ActType     | Length        | Data Addr   | -             | -           | -           |
| `0x3`       | Pooling      | PoolType    | Stride        | Length      | Data Addr     | -           | -           |
| `0x4`       | Load         | Length      | Src Addr      | Dest Addr   | -             | -           | -           |
| `0x5`       | Store        | Length      | Src Addr      | Dest Addr   | -             | -           | -           |

### Bit Widths and Explanations:

- **OpCode**: 4 bits. This field determines the operation type.
- **MapSize**: 3 bits. Encoding for the feature map size as previously described.
- **Stride**: 1 bit. Determines convolution stride:
  - `0`: Stride of 1
  - `1`: Stride of 2
- **Kernel**: 2 bits. Specifies the size of the convolution kernel:
  - `00`: 1x1
  - `01`: 3x3
  - `10`: 5x5
  - `11`: 7x7
- **FeatureMap, Weight, Data Addr, Src Addr, Dest Addr**: Addresses in memory or within the accelerator. Exact bit-width varies based on instruction but can range from 2 to 12 bits in the current design.
- **ActType**: 1 bit. Specifies the type of activation function:
  - `0`: ReLU
  - `1`: Sigmoid
- **PoolType**: 1 bit. Specifies the type of pooling operation:
  - `0`: Max Pooling
  - `1`: Average Pooling
- **Length**: 2 bits (in Activation, Load, and Store). Represents the operand size or amount of data to transfer.
- **Bias**: 2 bits. Address for bias values.

### Notes:

1. The adjustments made ensure that the Kernel can represent the four specified sizes, and the ActType and PoolType fields are now 1 bit each as per your requirements.
2. The FeatureMap, Weight, Data Addr, Src Addr, and Dest Addr fields' exact bit-widths will vary based on the operation. You may need to balance these widths based on typical use-cases and data access patterns.
3. An efficient ISA should align well with common operations and data patterns in the targeted applications. This ensures maximum hardware utilization and efficient memory accesses.

Can you please give me an idea of some of the functional blocks I will need?

### ChatGPT:
Certainly! Designing a CNN AI accelerator involves creating specialized hardware blocks that can efficiently execute the operations defined by your ISA. Here's a breakdown of the functional blocks you might need based on the provided ISA:

1. **Instruction Decoder**: 
   - Interprets the OpCode and directs the operation to the appropriate functional block.
   - Extracts the fields from the instruction and provides them as inputs to the relevant blocks.

2. **Convolution Engine**:
   - Takes inputs such as MapSize, Stride, Kernel, FeatureMap, Weight, and Bias.
   - Performs the convolution operation.
   - May include specialized multipliers and adders for efficient computation.
   - Can have a local buffer or cache to store intermediate results.

3. **Activation Function Unit**:
   - Computes activation functions like ReLU or Sigmoid based on the ActType.
   - May have lookup tables (LUTs) or specialized circuits for each activation type.

4. **Pooling Unit**:
   - Performs pooling operations (Max or Average) based on the PoolType.
   - Requires comparators for Max Pooling and adders/dividers for Average Pooling.

5. **Memory Interface**:
   - Handles data transfers for Load and Store operations.
   - Interfaces with external memory or on-chip memory.
   - Manages Src Addr, Dest Addr, and Length fields.

6. **Control Unit**:
   - Manages the overall control flow and sequencing of operations.
   - Generates control signals for other blocks based on the decoded instruction.

7. **Register File or Local Buffer**:

   - Can be used to set modes, thresholds, or other global parameters.

12. **DMA (Direct Memory Access) Controller**:
   - Manages data transfers between the accelerator and external memory without involving the main CPU.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Parallelism**: Depending on the performance requirements, you might want to consider adding multiple parallel processing units or pipelines to handle multiple operations simultaneously.
  
- **Optimization**: Hardware optimizations such as loop unrolling, pipelining, and data reuse can significantly improve the performance of the accelerator.

- **Flexibility vs. Efficiency**: A more flexible design can handle a wider range of operations but might be less efficient than a design optimized for a specific set of operations.

Remember, the exact blocks and their specifications will depend on your performance, power, and area requirements. It's essential to iterate on the design, simulate its performance, and make necessary adjustments based on the results.

I update the Pooling INS to this:
0x3	Pooling	WindowSize	Stride	Length	Data Addr	-	-
Bit Widths and Explanations:
OpCode: 4 bits. Determines the operation type.
Stride: 1 bit. Determines convolution and pooling stride:
0: Stride of 1
1: Stride of 2
WindowSize: 1 bit. Specifies the pooling window size:
0: 2x2
1: 3x3
Data Addr: Addressing fields. Their bit-widths range based on the instruction, from 2 to 12 bits.
Length: 2 bits. Indicates the operand size or data amount to transfer in specific instructions.
Notes:
The WindowSize field's simplification reflects the pooling sizes used in the provided models, optimizing the ISA specifically for these cases.

### ChatGPT:
Alright, based on the updated Pooling instruction, here's the SPEC for the Pooling Unit:

### Pooling Unit:

- **Input**:
  - **WindowSize**: 1 bit.
    - `0`: 2x2 window size.
    - `1`: 3x3 window size.
  - **Stride**: 1 bit.
    - `0`: Stride of 1.
    - `1`: Stride of 2.
  - **Length**: 2 bits. Indicates the operand size or data amount to process.
  - **Data Addr**: Addressing field. Bit-width varies based on the instruction, ranging from 2 to 12 bits. This address indicates where the data to be pooled is located.

- **Output**:
  - Pooled data, which will be stored back to the memory or passed to another unit for further processing.

- **Functionality**:
  - Based on the WindowSize and Stride, the unit will perform pooling operation on the data fetched from the address specified by Data Addr.
  - The pooling operation can be either Max Pooling or Average Pooling, depending on the overall design (not specified in the updated instruction).

- **Performance**:
  - The unit should be capable of pooling multiple data points per cycle, especially for larger window sizes.
  - The processing time will depend on the window size, stride, and the specific pooling operation.

- **Notes**:
  - The Pooling Unit will need access to memory (or a local buffer) to fetch the data specified by Data Addr.
  - The exact performance metrics, such as throughput and latency, will depend on the design constraints and technology node.
  - Error handling, boundary conditions (for data at the edges), and other specific details will need to be considered during the design phase.

Remember, while the ISA provides the instruction format and basic operation details, the actual hardware design will need to consider various factors like parallelism, pipelining, and data access patterns to achieve the desired performance.
