Act as a professional SystemVerilog Programmer.

## Assistant (Bing):
Sure, I can help you with SystemVerilog programming. SystemVerilog is a hardware description and hardware verification language used to model, design, simulate, test and implement electronic systems. SystemVerilog is based on Verilog and some extensions, and since 2008 Verilog is now part of the same IEEE standard. It is commonly used in the semiconductor and electronic design industry. If you have any specific questions or need help with certain aspects of SystemVerilog, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š

Give me an example of

```systemverilog
  module Counter(
  input clk, rst_n,
  output logic clk2
);
...
endmodule
```

### I/O Interface
| Input Signals | Bit Width | Definitions |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| clk           | 1         | Clock signal |
| rst_n         | 1         | Asynchronous reset and active-low signal |

| Output Signals | Bit Width | Definitions |
| -------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| clk2           | 1         | Clock where freq. is a quarter of clk |

### Specification

#### Module Function
The module should generate a clock signal `clk2` whose frequency is a quarter of the input clock signal `clk`. The clock signal `clk2` should be 0 after the reset signal is asserted.
After reset, at the first time it encounters the rising edge of the clock signal `clk`, the clock signal `clk2` should be HIGH for 2 periods first. Then, the clock signal `clk2` should be LOW for 2 periods and HIGH for 2 periods alternately.

#### Constraints
1. Avoid the usage of for-loop.
2. The design should be successfully compiled and synthesized without any warnings, errors, or latch inference.
3. Given `clk` period is 10ns, the slack in the timing report should be met.
4. Gate level simulation cannot include any timing violations.

## Assistant (Bing):
Here is an example of a SystemVerilog module that meets your specifications:

```systemverilog!=
module Counter(
  input wire clk, rst_n,
  output logic clk2
);
  reg [1:0] count = 0;
  always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
      count <= 0;
      clk2 <= 0;
    end else begin
      count <= count + 1;
      if (count == 2'b11) begin
        count <= 0;
      end
      clk2 <= (count < 2);
    end
  end
endmodule


```

### Explanation:
In this code, a 2-bit register count is used to divide the clock frequency by four. The count register increments at every rising edge of clk and resets when rst_n is active (low). The output clk2 is high when the value of count is less than 2, and low otherwise. This ensures that clk2 is high for two periods and low for two periods alternately, starting from high after reset. This design should meet all your constraints. Please let me know if you have any questions! ðŸ˜Š

## User:
You use Verilog. That is not correct. You should use SystemVerilog.

## Assistant (Bing):
I apologize for the confusion. Youâ€™re right, the code I provided was in Verilog. Hereâ€™s the corrected version in SystemVerilog:

```systemverilog!=
module Counter(
  input logic clk, rst_n,
  output logic clk2
);
  logic [1:0] count = 2'b00;
  always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
      count <= 2'b00;
      clk2 <= 0;
    end else begin
      count <= count + 1;
      if (count == 2'b11) begin
        count <= 2'b00;
      end
      clk2 <= (count < 2);
    end
  end
endmodule


```

### Explanation:
In this SystemVerilog code, Iâ€™ve used logic instead of reg and wire, and always_ff instead of always. These are some of the enhancements that SystemVerilog provides over Verilog. The functionality remains the same as described before. Please let me know if you have any further questions! ðŸ˜Š

## User:
Multiple drivers to always_ff output variable count detected.

---

## Assistant (Bing):
I apologize for the confusion. Youâ€™re correct, the count variable is driven by multiple drivers in the always_ff block, which is not allowed in SystemVerilog. Hereâ€™s the corrected version:

```systemverilog!=
module Counter(
  input logic clk, rst_n,
  output logic clk2
);
  logic [1:0] count;
  always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
      count <= '0;
      clk2 <= 0;
    end else begin
      count <= (count == 2'b11) ? '0 : count + 1'b1;
      clk2 <= (count < 2);
    end
  end
endmodule


```

### Explanation:
In this code, Iâ€™ve used a conditional operator (?:) to ensure that count is only driven by a single driver within the always_ff block. The functionality remains the same as described before. Please let me know if you have any further questions! ðŸ˜Š
