How much do you know about the poker game "射龍門"?

---

## Assistant (GPT-4):
"射龍門" (Shooting the Dragon Gate) is not a widely known or popular poker game variant in Western cultures, and as of my last update in September 2021, it's not a standard poker game I'm familiar with. However, if you can provide a brief explanation or the rules of the game, I can certainly attempt to help design SystemVerilog modules based on those specifications.

## User:
Give me an example of

```systemverilog
module Seq(
  input clk, rst_n, in_valid, [3:0]in_data,
  output logic out_data, out_valid
);
...
endmodule
```

### I/O Interface
| Input Signals | Bit Width | Definitions |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| clk           | 1         | Clock signal |
| rst_n         | 1         | Asynchronous reset and active-low signal |
| in_valid      | 1         | High when input is valid |
| in_data       | 4         | a random series of numbers input when in_valid is high, standing for poker cards |

| Output Signals | Bit Width | Definitions |
| -------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| out_data       | 1         | If satisfy the winning condition output 1, otherwise output 0 |
| out_valid      | 1         | High when output is valid (That is, once you have recorded at least 3 in_data as two doors and one ball in hand, the out_valid turns high |

### Specification
"射龍門" is a type of poker game where players are dealt two cards(doors). If the third card(ball) falls within the range, the player wins; otherwise, they lose. Here are some examples. 
1. If the two door cards are A and K (1 and 13), the ball card can be 2~Q(2~12) to win the game while A or K can not.
2. If the two door cards are 7 and 8, no matter what the ball card is, it cannot satisfy the winning condition.

#### Module Function
This module detects the winning condition of the poker game "射龍門". 
* If three adjacent in_data points satisfy the condition that the first and third numbers are door cards and the second number is a ball card.
* Output 1 if the conditions for scoring a goal are met,and 0 otherwise.
* After each game, discard the first card (first door) and draw the new card from in_data. Start the next game with the second card (ball) turned into the first one (first door), the third card (second door) turned into the second one (ball), and the in_data as the third one (second door), and so on.
* EX: 
    * input data: 13 / 9 / 2 / 4 / 6
    * output data should be: 1 / 0 / 1
    * (13>9 9>2) / (9>2 2<4) / (2<4 4<6)

#### Constraints
1. Avoid the usage of for-loop.
2. The design should be successfully compiled and synthesized without any warnings, errors, or latch inference.
3. Given `clk` period is 10ns, the slack in the timing report should be met.
4. Gate level simulation cannot include any timing violations.

### To-Do
Try to realize this design in a step-by-step way. I recommend you to demonstrate you design idea in advance, and then start to design by following your design idea. 

---

## Assistant (GPT-4):
Alright, let's break this down step-by-step:

### Design Idea

#### 1. **Shifting Register**:
We will create a 3-stage shift register. Every clock cycle, when `in_valid` is high, we shift the values in the register to the left. The first stage is the oldest value, the third stage is the newest value.

#### 2. **Logic for Winning Condition**:
We'll use combinational logic to check the condition for the game win. For a win:

1. The ball card (middle card) must be greater than the first door card but less than the third door card.
2. OR, the ball card must be less than the first door card but greater than the third door card.

These two conditions ensure that the ball card falls between the two door cards, but not equal to them.

#### 3. **Output Valid**:
`out_valid` is high when we have at least three values in our shift register, which means the second and third stages have valid values.

#### 4. **Output Data**:
`out_data` indicates a win or loss, as determined by the logic in step 2.

### SystemVerilog Implementation

Let's start implementing this design idea:

```systemverilog
module Seq(
  input clk, rst_n, in_valid,
  input [3:0] in_data,
  output logic out_data,
  output logic out_valid
);

  // Step 1: 3-stage shift register
  logic [3:0] door1, door2, ball;

  always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
      door1 <= 4'b0;
      ball <= 4'b0;
      door2 <= 4'b0;
    end else if (in_valid) begin
      door1 <= ball;
      ball <= door2;
      door2 <= in_data;
    end
  end

  // Step 2: Logic for winning condition
  logic win_condition1, win_condition2;

  assign win_condition1 = (ball > door1) && (ball < door2);
  assign win_condition2 = (ball < door1) && (ball > door2);
  assign out_data = win_condition1 || win_condition2;

  // Step 3 & 4: Output valid and data
  logic register_filled;

  // We check if door1 and door2 are non-zero to ensure we have 3 cards in place
  assign register_filled = door1 && door2;
  assign out_valid = register_filled;

endmodule
```

#### Notes:

- I avoided using for-loops as per the constraints.
- The design should not infer latches given that we've provided conditions for all scenarios in the always block.
- For synthesis and gate level simulation, you would need to use an external tool. This design should meet the timing requirements given the simplicity, but real-world synthesis and simulation would be required to guarantee this.

You can now take this design to your synthesis and simulation tool to verify its functionality and check for any timing violations.

## User:
Your idea is great! However there's a little problem. `out_valid` should turn low when there's no longer in_data.

---

## Assistant (GPT-4):
Thank you for pointing that out!

To handle the scenario where `out_valid` should go low when there's no new `in_data`, we can introduce a counter. This counter will count how many valid inputs (`in_valid` is high) we've received. Once we've received 3 valid inputs, the `out_valid` signal will be set high. If there's no new `in_data` (i.e., `in_valid` is low), then the counter will decrement, and if the counter goes to zero, `out_valid` will go low.

Here's the modification to the design:

```systemverilog
module Seq(
  input clk, rst_n, in_valid,
  input [3:0] in_data,
  output logic out_data,
  output logic out_valid
);

  // Step 1: 3-stage shift register
  logic [3:0] door1, door2, ball;

  always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
      door1 <= 4'b0;
      ball <= 4'b0;
      door2 <= 4'b0;
    end else if (in_valid) begin
      door1 <= ball;
      ball <= door2;
      door2 <= in_data;
    end
  end

  // Step 2: Logic for winning condition
  logic win_condition1, win_condition2;

  assign win_condition1 = (ball > door1) && (ball < door2);
  assign win_condition2 = (ball < door1) && (ball > door2);
  assign out_data = win_condition1 || win_condition2;

  // Step 3 & 4: Output valid and data
  logic [2:0] valid_counter;  // 3-bit counter to count up to 3 valid inputs

  always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
      valid_counter <= 3'b000;
    end else if (in_valid && valid_counter < 3) begin
      valid_counter <= valid_counter + 1'b1;
    end else if (!in_valid && valid_counter > 0) begin
      valid_counter <= valid_counter - 1'b1;
    end
  end

  assign out_valid = (valid_counter == 3);

endmodule
```

This modification ensures that:
- `out_valid` will be high as long as we have 3 valid inputs.
- `out_valid` will go low if we haven't received new `in_data` for 3 consecutive clock cycles after the last valid input.

## User:
OK, this is a brilliant idea, but there's something you need to know. When `in_valid` turns low, it turns out that you need to clear your hand card.   

---

## Assistant (GPT-4):
Got it. If `in_valid` is low, it means new data isn't coming in and the hand cards should be cleared. This means both the shift register and the valid counter should be reset.

Here's how we can integrate that requirement:

```systemverilog
module Seq(
  input clk, rst_n, in_valid,
  input [3:0] in_data,
  output logic out_data,
  output logic out_valid
);

  // Step 1: 3-stage shift register
  logic [3:0] door1, door2, ball;

  always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
      door1 <= 4'b0;
      ball <= 4'b0;
      door2 <= 4'b0;
    end else if (in_valid) begin
      door1 <= ball;
      ball <= door2;
      door2 <= in_data;
    end else begin
      door1 <= 4'b0;
      ball <= 4'b0;
      door2 <= 4'b0;
    end
  end

  // Step 2: Logic for winning condition
  logic win_condition1, win_condition2;

  assign win_condition1 = (ball > door1) && (ball < door2);
  assign win_condition2 = (ball < door1) && (ball > door2);
  assign out_data = win_condition1 || win_condition2;

  // Step 3 & 4: Output valid and data
  logic [2:0] valid_counter;  // 3-bit counter to count up to 3 valid inputs

  always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n || !in_valid) begin
      valid_counter <= 3'b000;
    end else if (in_valid && valid_counter < 3) begin
      valid_counter <= valid_counter + 1'b1;
    end
  end

  assign out_valid = (valid_counter == 3);

endmodule
```

With these modifications:
- When `in_valid` is low, the cards in hand (door1, ball, and door2) are cleared/reset.
- The valid counter is also reset when `in_valid` is low.
- This ensures that the game resets and waits for new inputs when there's no valid data.

The error messages above shows when the design is synthesized. Fix it.

---

## Assistant (GPT-4):
The error you're encountering arises because the synthesis tool is expecting a simple reset condition (like `!rst_n`), and not a compound condition (like `!rst_n || !in_valid`). The compound condition works for simulation, but many synthesis tools prefer a single, dedicated reset condition for clarity and to avoid ambiguity.

To fix this, we can change our design approach slightly:

1. Use `rst_n` as the sole reset condition in the `always` blocks.
2. Introduce additional logic to generate a "clear" signal when `in_valid` is low. This clear signal will be used to reset the contents of the registers and counters when `in_valid` is low.

Here's the corrected code:

```systemverilog
module Seq(
  input clk, rst_n, in_valid,
  input [3:0] in_data,
  output logic out_data,
  output logic out_valid
);

  // Step 0: Generate a clear signal when in_valid is low
  logic clear;
  assign clear = !in_valid;

  // Step 1: 3-stage shift register
  logic [3:0] door1, door2, ball;

  always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
      door1 <= 4'b0;
      ball <= 4'b0;
      door2 <= 4'b0;
    end else if (in_valid) begin
      door1 <= ball;
      ball <= door2;
      door2 <= in_data;
    end else if (clear) begin
      door1 <= 4'b0;
      ball <= 4'b0;
      door2 <= 4'b0;
    end
  end

  // Step 2: Logic for winning condition
  logic win_condition1, win_condition2;

  assign win_condition1 = (ball > door1) && (ball < door2);
  assign win_condition2 = (ball < door1) && (ball > door2);
  assign out_data = win_condition1 || win_condition2;

  // Step 3 & 4: Output valid and data
  logic [2:0] valid_counter;  // 3-bit counter to count up to 3 valid inputs

  always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
      valid_counter <= 3'b000;
    end else if (in_valid && valid_counter < 3) begin
      valid_counter <= valid_counter + 1'b1;
    end else if (clear) begin
      valid_counter <= 3'b000;
    end
  end

  assign out_valid = (valid_counter == 3);

endmodule
```

Now, the `always` blocks have simple reset conditions, and the clear functionality is handled by the `clear` signal, which should be synthesis-friendly.
